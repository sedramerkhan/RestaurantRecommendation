# Restaurant Recommendation System

When a person decides to go to a restaurant, he may feel confused due to the large number of choices available,
as there are many diverse restaurants in terms of their prices, meals, and locations. He searches for the best food for the best price and the shortest distance. 
Therefore, we have created the __Fuzzy Expert__ System to suggest a suitable restaurant for the person in the city of _Damascus_.
This system takes as input:
- The type of food served in the restaurant (__cuisine__).
- The average __price__ of a meal in the restaurant in Syrian pounds.
- The __location__ of the restaurant.
  
Then it provides a suggestion score for this restaurant from 0 to 10 based on the previous inputs.

## Technology
We build desktop application using Python and Tkinter GUI library in addition to google maps widget.
